# Weather App
## Functionalities
Sample Weather App with the theme of the character I like from blue archive.
Has the functionality to sign in and sign up users
search for the weather forecast details of the desired location
save history of the previously searched location and when pressed, it searches the details again and leads the user back to the dashboard page,
the app also has MVVM structure and implemented possible error handlings I could think of.

Here's my favorite student!
